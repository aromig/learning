## Workshop Overview

Welcome!

In this workshop we are going dive into three modern areas of JavaScript:

1. Flow Control: Promises
3. JS Design Patterns and Best Practices - Code Organization, modules  and Bundling
2. Service Workers


We're going to start things off by leaning Promises and Async+Await by themselves, and then move into building a photo booth application where we can apply Async+Await while learning about modules and service workers.


## These Notes

These notes aren't comprehensive, but meant to be used as a rough guide though today. I'll have a few talking points in the notes that I will expand upon. Most importantly, the all the code we write today will be in the notes so that if you ever get lost or need to refence someone we missed, you can grab it from here!

## Asking Questions

Please do! No stupid questions.
